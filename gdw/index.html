<h1> Special Characters</h1>

<p> Since <,> and & have special meaning in HTML, you can't 
use these character to represent themselves Instead you need to use the so
 called "special characters" to represent them. For example, to have a less
 than sign appear in your document, you need to use &lt; to represent it.
