    Inline Elements
</h1>

<body>
    Inline elements are used to markup text inside a block element like a paragraph or division. Each element does different things to the text. 
   <b>This text is in a strong element. This text is in a bold (b) element</b>
    Bold and strong seem to have the same effect. 
    <i>This is emphasised (em) text.</i>
    It seems to look the same as this <i>italicized text here</i>
    <br>
    Putting text inside quote elements, "like this quoted text here", makes the text display with quotation markes around it. Code(code) tags are meant for source code examples. They look like <code>code text here.</code> 
    The keyboard element (kbd)looks like same, <kbd>keyboard text here</kbd>, but is meant for examples of user entered data.
    </br>
    <br>
    Superscript and subscript elements do what they say. <sup>this is supercsript</sup> and <sub>this is subscript</sub>
    </br>
    <br>
    Span elements don't seem to do anything at all. I've put about every other inside span tags.</br>
    <br> Can you tell which is which? </br>
