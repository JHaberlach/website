    <h4> 
       What solution are we using to the problem presented in the chapter of finding yourself a hosting company? What are the advantages and disadvantages of our solution? What alternatives could we have used, and which alternative did we use earlier in the year?
    </h4>



    <p>
        The solution we have found is to use Github.com and although we do not own the framework it provides a free and easy tool to learn how to make webpages with. Before using github.com our class connected to a server to host our pages.

</h4>


<ul>

       The steps to register under your own domain name is too...
       <ol type="1">
           <li>Find a hosting company like Dreamhost or Bluehost and tel them about your want. Often they will tell you that you can get one in one of their deals </li>
           <li>Come up with your domain name, pick a suffix.</li>
           <li>Purchase the domain name, add domain ID Protection to protect your domain</li>

    <h4>
    Compare the workflow presented in the book (which is a bit old at this point) with the one we use. How are they different? How are they similar?
</h4>
</ul>


<p>
