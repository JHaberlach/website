    <h4> 
       What solution are we using to the problem presented in the chapter of finding yourself a hosting company? What are the advantages and disadvantages of our solution? What alternatives could we have used, and which alternative did we use earlier in the year?
    </h4>



    <p>
        The solution we have found is to use Github.com and although we do not own the framework it provides a free and easy tool to learn how to make webpages with. Before using github.com our class connected to a server to host our pages.

<h4>
    A few of our enterprising classmates have taken the initiative to register their own domain name.See if you can find these classmates and ask them how they did it.What is the process involved? Where can you go to register a domain name?
</h4>


<ul>
    <p>
       The steps to register under your own domain name is too... <br>
        1) Find a hosting company like Dreamhost or Bluehost and tel them about your want. Often they will tell you that you can get one in one of their deals<br>
        2) Come up with your domain name, pick a suffix. <br>
        3) Purchase the domain name, add domain ID Protection to protect your domain <br>
        4) Some places to regesiter are Google, Catch Domains, and Claimeddomains<br>
    </p>
</ul>

    <h4>
    Compare the workflow presented in the book (which is a bit old at this point) with the one we use. How are they different? How are they similar?
</h4>
</ul>


<p>
    They are different because in the textbook workflow you would log in to an FTP(File Transfer Protocol) and transfer your files to a directory there. Where as in class we use github commit,push,add to add our files to github<br>
     They are similar in how both were used to move files but github is more flexible and more secure
