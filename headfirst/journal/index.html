        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely wont be be passing any cars.

    <p>
         first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
        I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
